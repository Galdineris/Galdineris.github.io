**Chaos Game was one of the winners of WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge**

Inspired by The Chaos Game at Between Art and Science by Tom Bates, this is a simple fractal drawing SwiftPlaygrounds playground using the Chaos Game “method” and SpriteKit.

I've actually submitted the first version of this playground to WWDC19 but was rejected. After a year of studying, I've decided to refactor the code a little and fix some few bugs that would haunt me at night. To my surprise, it was accepted in this years edition of the event. 

[I've made this video demonstrating the playground if you would like to see it running.](https://youtu.be/LU7Z1dWoP_I)
