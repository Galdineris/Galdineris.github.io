#  D천pu

![Dopu Logo](/GaldinerisTheme/dopu.jpg)

This is a Fast-Paced Game based on surrealism's characteristics. 

The main character is D천pu, that is a colorful and curious creature. You will discover many colorful skins of D천pu while creating experience in the game.

This was a very fun project in which I've had to explore my creative side. Apart from some work on the Storyboards for the game, I was also heavly involved in the game design and was responsible for the main soundtrack of the game.
