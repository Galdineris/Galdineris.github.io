# MCI

![MCI Logo](/GaldinerisTheme/mci.png)

MCI is an simple gratitude journaling app. 

Loosely inspired by the play "*Every Brilliant Thing*" written by Duncan Macmillan, MCI aims to help you list everything that helps make life a little better. Its purpose is to help you get up when you are feeling a little down. A feeling, an object or even a person. If you like it, why not help future you to not forget it?

The app was made in the span of 1 month using XIB-driven UI, persistence through Core Data and Local Notifications. It was developed entirely by myself, from ideation through design and development until finally deployment at App Store. It replicates a "sheet" view controller, which is displayed constantly at the bottom of the screen and can slide into full view with swiping gestures (i.e. Apple Maps search menu or Apple Stocks detail view).
