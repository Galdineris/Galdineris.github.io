## Ol√°!

My name's Rafael Galdino and I'm a iOS developer. Well, to be more accurate, I'm a Brazillian software developer specialized in Swift and iOS who worked on a few projects here and there _(if only there was a handy section of [my projects](projects/index.html) somewhere around here...)_. 

I worked before with software engineering as an intern at a big bank and with management as an eSports analyst for a games company _(For more information on my professional escapades, please refer to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafael-galdino/). And while you're at it, feel free to send that connect.)_. Recently, I had the honor of attending Apple Developer Academy where I got to improve my skills as a developer as
a whole and even win the Swift Student Challenge of WWDC20.

Overall, I'm just a developer who likes to help. I always searching for ways to make something easier or better for my colleagues.
Either when I learning a new technology or dicovering how to use a new tool, I'm eager to share it with other people! 

Thank you for reading this, have a great day!

P.S. I enjoy to continue my discussions on rules and group problem solving trough tabletop RPGs. It's surprisingly fun and I would recommend to anyone to try it, at least once. (I don't have a handy link for this but you can have some [lemons]() instead).
